How to use it:

Wherever whenever you feel like adding some color (for those who have
colorlevel >= NORMAL) you just do something like this:

&1Red&0 &4Blue&0 and so on.. Works in room_descs, gossips, tells, you name it.

Here's a list of the color-codes:

0 Normal attributes
1 red
2 green
3 yellow
4 blue
5 magenta
6 cyan
7 white
8 bold
9 black

u underline
d dark
b bright
R red bground
G green brgound
B Blue bground
Y yellow brgound
M magenta bground
C Cyan bground
W white bground
S black bground (S as in Svart (swedish))
& the character &

Anything other than these characters, will produce nothing.
